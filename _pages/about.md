<p class="section-title font-tertiary" style="font-size: 25px; line-height:1.5">My name is Matthieu, I am an aspiring Experience Designer with a background in Graphic Design that complete itself with Art and Illustration skills.</p>

My goal in Experience Design is to understand people's needs in specific contexts in order to create interfaces and environments they can purposefully interact with. I aim to develop a stack of complementary skills that would benefit from each other and to others, and I currently am acquiring some front-end development basics to better understand the bridge between designer and developer. on the more personal side I am still working on my drawing and painting skills, both on traditional and digital mediums.

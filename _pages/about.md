<p class="section-title font-tertiary" style="font-size: 25px">My name is Matthieu, I am an aspiring Experience Designer with a background in Graphic Design that complete itself with Art and Illustration skills.</p>
My goal in Experience Design is to understand people's needs in specific contexts in order to create experiences, interfaces and environments they can purposefully interact with. My experience in Graphic Design and Visual Art in general take care of the aesthetical needs while my own perspective is there for the principles that drive an intention. 

I aim to develop a stack of complementary skills that would benefit from each other and to others, and I currently am acquiring some front-end development basics to better understand the bridge between designer and developer that can in some situations be a challenge. On the more personal side I am still working on my drawing and painting skills, both on traditional and digital mediums.

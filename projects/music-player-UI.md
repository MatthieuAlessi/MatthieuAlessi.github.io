An exercise about the UI design of a music player. The use of subtle geometric shapes like dots and lines give rhythm and structure to the information of the interface. It is a throwback to musical staves and their nomenclature. The circular interaction used to choose a music takes from the affordance of the vinyl/physical disc, it is a form of skeumorphism.

Most music players bear a lot of similarities, some can be indistinguishable from one another. I wanted here to give this tool a more distinct visual identity and to give a nod to the original medium of music.

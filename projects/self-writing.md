<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">Prototype of a service that guides the user through the drafting process of academic writing, allows him to set deadlines and eventually publish the writing on the plateform for reviews. The mock-ups follow the steps from welcome to writing a topic, as well as the search option. This quick prototype has been thought for an academic context at first with a possible use in the context of online classes, but also for a personal writing tool with self-accountability. </div>

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">It was supposed to be a more fleshed out and accurate design, but it has been put on hold for a while. The mock-ups here follow the steps from the homepage to the writing stage, as well as the search option. </div>

**For over a decade, Follow The Camino has been giving its customers the possibility to take break and rekindle their souls with the planning of walking and cycling holidays. However their interface used by customers to plan their booking and pay needed a revamping to be more welcoming, and to promote a wider and autonomous use to those concerned.**

With a customer base of mostly people in their 50s or even 60s, the Client Area previously had the problem of being too austere and unclear. Ultimately the goal is to make it what itâ€™s meant to be, an interface where the client can confidently plan for him and his trip partners, but also be informed about his upcoming walking holiday. If the Camino is all about wellbeing, the interfaces Follow The Camino customers use should refect that and feel rewarding.

After studying FTC's buyer personas, we decided to focus on specific points and common issues to focus on in order to improve the Client Area. The target audience is between 40 and 60 years old, still active and enjoy trips. They are able to use modern technologies to some extent and are on social media, they like to know what they are paying for and they need reassurance about the planning of their trip. The interface needs to give agency to the user, be clear in its steps and provides automatic guidance to avoid frustrations. 

Simply changing the CSS wasn't enough, the process needed to be streamlined while not alienating previous and recurring users. To do so, I directly worked from the Client Area's User-Flow and created a new one.

This new User Flow aims to stay faithful to the previous process, which was functional, while improving on it. The new process gives more possibility for an autonomous use for someone less used to digital interfaces and give control and security to the customer.

Sketches were made and I quickly focused on building the interface with blocks. Since the Client Area doesn't need to be cluttered with infornation, it gives more freedom to use the layout space. The customer has more time to take in the information. 

There was the opportunity to integrate the FTC brand in the Client Area, through the UI and by linking it to the website with links and articles placed in the process. The use blocks is here to showcase important elements, and to help with hierarchy and directing the user where he needs to go.

Working with developers made me nore attuned to the needs and process related to development, I had to take into account the structure of the code and how the interface would be built.

> By consolidating affordances and building on functionnality and identity, the intention is to leave a stronger mark.

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">To define users' goals and potential functionalities, users cases were created. The prototyped process goes from the login stage to the user's selection and experience of a podcast episode.</div>

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">To bring a more accurate management of the content favored by the user, I included the creation of playlists for podcast episodes, and lists for shows, access to a history as well as user favorites. Simple tools of classification allowing the creation of one's own podcast library.

A more intuitive way of searching for specific content, to easily find a podcast or a creator's channel according to similarities and topics, or to simply add a link. The user can base his search on similarities with his following and  on specific topics of interest.</div>

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">A direct access to the links and websites of the creators he follows, and a possibility to rate and interact with the podcast itself brings a stronger aspect of community and interaction.

To enhance the listening experience, audio parameters were included to configure playback speed, ambiance mode according to the external environment (transport, interior, etc.), or a sleep timer. Access to transcript and times codes provided by the community of the creator, or the creator himself.</div>

> The lightning is a nod to an era of the past but also represent the ever-accelerarting progress of technology and communication, it is an everlasting symbol.

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">Wirecast's visual identity is sleek and straight-forward, unassuming yet recognizable enough with a modern color palette of dark blue and bright yellow. The lightning is a nod to radio broadcasting and a sign of dynamism the concept aims to reach.
The social functions help to connect the users and the creators the way most modern media do, and it benefits the format itself. This project shows how much untapped potential lies in podcasting, but the similarities with other prevalent online media raises questions about its true place. Where does podcasting stands between live-streaming and video content creation ? </div>

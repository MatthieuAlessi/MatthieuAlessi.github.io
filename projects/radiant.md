**Radiant is a concept created mainly as an occupation and a personal exercise. With a focus on the identity and how to make a small-scale restaurant modern, there was an interesting premise. The goal: to create the concept of a unique culinary experience that remains approachable and practical. **

User Experience design is about setting the stage and the conditions for positive, useful and in the better cases meaningful experiences and interactions. Those interactions are engaged through the user's senses, from that we can think about the connection between user experience and the culinary fields, beyond the food itself.


After defining a target audience with personas and through a series of research, I thought about what kind of restaurant experience my defined target of mostly young adults would want. Good food and service are baseline requirements, but it needs to be affordable and practical. The experience should be unique, and have well defined purpose and identity. 

The overall direction was quickly turned towards futurism and science fiction, it is an interesting theme because of its aesthetics and implications. After research and building moodboards, I decided to go for a themed restaurant that would focus on offering a particular sensory experience and a futuristic atmosphere, I wanted to go for a gentler type of Blade Runner aesthetic.


After defining the intent, the identity needed to be shaped without trapping itself in a dated gimmick. To retain a sense of elegance I took from japanese iconography the opportunity to use illustration as a visual branding tool. This influence appears first on the logo, who takes its circular and inviting shape form the rising sun, and in the branding illustration.

Combining futurism and Japanese iconography, The logo takes the circular and inviting shape from the rising sun. The name also evokes a sense of hope for the next day. Exciting splashes of neon color, and lively illustrations, and unusual remind us of how our senses can light up through positive experiences.

I thought Radiant as an inviting and original place that remains practical, to keep things modern and ease the customer's interaction, I designed an interface used to order. A 3d model was made to have an idea in the layout and organization of the place. The terminals are placed on spots where customers may be likely to stand while finding their way around.

> Visually representing values, going from words to visuals.

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">
By finding the keywords defining the school, what it represents and stands for, we are able to synthesize its values and aspects to highlight. From these words and definitions, it became possible to start working the school's visual identity with a draft. To drive home the message and the purpose of the school, I went with basic geometric elements and flat primary colors, relating to early development, the roots of learning and construction games.

After the graphic principles were defined, they were applied to a logo, then to a pattern system that could be easily declined on different supports. The combinations of simple shapes and colors bring back to elementary education and emphasize the importance of the individual from an early age.
